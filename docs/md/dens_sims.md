# Minimal Empirical Density Estimation

## Simulation results



The first plot shows a histogram of the original simulated data, overlain with boostrap resamples drawn from the crudely estimated density, and finally, a new density estimation performed post-bootstrap.
The second plot shows the same, but incorporates an intermediary step involving linear approximation.
This allows the subsequent draws to be more continuous.
