### Files and Data
Input files include polygon shapefiles commonly used at SNAP and two of SNAP's current geotiff data products, Alaska-Canada 2-km downscaled climate data and 1-km Alfresco simulation outputs.
Output files are **R** workspaces, .RData files.
There is one workspace storing each version of a nested list for each type of rasterized data set.

### Code flow
The code flow is simple for this task, only involving a single **R** script.
However, a diagram is provided here to show it in the context of both input and output data.
